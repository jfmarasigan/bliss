VALUES ('5', 'Why is CTPL insurance important despite the limitations?', 
'First of all, CTPL is required by law, without it you cannot register your motor vehicle in the Land Transportation Office (LTO). Secondly, it may not provide much for the policy owner but it will ensure that it will prevent a degree of criminal liability for the him/her because he/she followed what the law has required for the compensation of a third party victim in the case of a future vehicular accident that may happen. Aside from that, the policy holder will be relieved of the worry of paying the third party victim out of his pocket alone because CTPL will cover at least some amount from what you are liable for. CTPL will also give assurance to the third party victims, that they won’t be left without any financial help. This, in a way, also protects the public.',
